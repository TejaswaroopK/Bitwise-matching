# ⚙️ Bitwise Matching Pattern Finder

A sleek, interactive web tool that finds the **next largest integer** with the **same number of `1` bits** in its binary representation. Useful for bit manipulation practice and understanding bit-level operations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project allows users to enter a non-negative integer and then computes the **next greater integer** that has the same number of `1`s in its binary representation (also known as “same bit count”). It’s a visual, browser-based bitwise utility.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `n`, find the smallest integer greater than `n` such that the number of `1` bits in the binary representation is the same as that of `n`.

## 💡 Features

- 🔢 Accepts any non-negative integer
- 🧮 Displays both decimal and binary representations
- 🧠 Efficient bitwise algorithm to compute next larger integer
- 💻 Clean and modern UI using HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- ❌ Handles edge cases (e.g., no valid next number exists)
